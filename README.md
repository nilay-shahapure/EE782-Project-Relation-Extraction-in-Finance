This is EE782 project, Relation extraction in Finance

Please find the dataset analyses files respectively for Finred, Refind and FIRE, for the SPN + Refind encoder comparison files, the project zip is uploaded so that it can access all files including the large REFIND train file living inside it.
In the data folder, all the datasets are stored and the REFIND dataset files are zipped to accomodate the very large REFIND train.json

Optionally for running the SPN architecture encoders on REFIND, you can access the REFIND zip in the data folder instead of ee782 project zip (the original uploaded ipynb uses this ee782 project zip)
